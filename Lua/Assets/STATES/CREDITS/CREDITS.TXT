Sitting too close to the TV really is bad for you...

















...unless you turn it off...
























A car is not a toy...


























...unless it's really, really fast and expensive...























Four out of five people surveyed will believe just about anything...






















I think that the problem with this video is that it is highly derivative of many popular bands within the genre... Although if viewed on its own merit, it does have a decent groove... But what it has in groove, it lacks in originality... One can't help but be reminded of bands such as Pearl Jam, White Zombie, Suicidal Tendencies, and other bands that bear the mantle of society's alternative rock... One can't help but be reminded of Lori Anderson when she wore curlers... Mheh heh heh... This video speak less to the mind, and more to the sphincter ... In closing, I think Korn would do well to <SMACK-SMACK-SMACK> AAHHHhh!
















I've been to Greece lately. It's very nice there. Kinda hot though. Have you guys been there?

Glad you have found this message. I just cannot believe I didn't leave any last time I've been here.







Seems like those random stuff we throw in here and there may have a great impact on the lives of others. 






Small footprints, written in the stone, left for decades...









I'll just leave you with that thought. Have a nice day!
